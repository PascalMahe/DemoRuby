INSTALLING RUBY : 
--------------------------------
 - get the RubyInstaller (see http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ for latest version).
 - check version in install_ruby.bat
	-> if different from 2.0.0 (x64), change it
 - run install_ruby.bat
 
--------------------------------
INSTALLING RUBY DevKit : 
--------------------------------
 - get the RubyDevKit (see http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ for latest version, coherent with Ruby version).
 - follow instructions here: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
 - copied here (date : 12/02/2014) : 
	-Step 3- Left double-click the self-extracting executable (SFX) downloaded from Step 2 and choose a directory (without spaces) to install the DevKit artifacts into. For example, C:\DevKit. NOTE: the SFX is really a 7-Zip archive with a bit of embedded magic. If you already have 7-Zip installed, you can simply right-click it and extract its contents as you would a normal 7z archive. In the instructions that follow, the directory that you selected is identified as <DEVKIT_INSTALL_DIR>. NOTE: Do not rename this directory because once you install in Step 4 the path is hardcoded into the Ruby installation. If you do need to rename the directory re-run Step 4 with the --force option.
	-Step 4- 
		- cd <DEVKIT_INSTALL_DIR> from Step 3 above.
		- ruby dk.rb init to generate the config.yml file to be used later in this Step. Your installed Rubies will be listed there (only those installed by a RubyInstaller package are detected at present).
		- edit the generated config.yml file to include installed Rubies not automatically discovered or remove Rubies you do not want to use the DevKit with.
		- [optional] ruby dk.rb review to review the list of Rubies to be enhanced to use the DevKit and verify the changes you made to it are correct.
		- finally, ruby dk.rb install to DevKit enhance your installed Rubies. This step installs (or updates) an operating_system.rb file into the relevant directory needed to implement a RubyGems pre_install hook and a devkit.rb helper library file into <RUBY_INSTALL_DIR>\lib\ruby\site_ruby. NOTE: you may need to use the --force option to update (with backup of the originals) the above mentioned files as discussed at the SFX DevKit upgrade FAQ entry.
		- If you use the x64 version of ruby you might get an error saying `Invalid configuration. Please fix ‘config.yml’ and rerun ‘ruby dk.rb install’`. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16523607/cant-get-ruby-devkit-configuration-file-autogenerated-properly
